# 💅 Clueless Wardrobe

> *"Cher's main thrill in life is a makeover. It gives her a sense of control in a world full of chaos."*

Welcome to the **Clueless Wardrobe** — a totally buggin' digital closet inspired by the iconic 1995 film that taught us all that plaid matching is an art form and "As if!" is a complete sentence.

## 🎬 The Inspiration

In celebration of Amy Heckerling's masterpiece and Alicia Silverstone's iconic portrayal of Cher Horowitz — the Beverly Hills teenager who understood that fashion is not frivolous, it's *fundamental*.

> *"I don't rely on mirrors so I always take Polaroids."*

This app channels the spirit of Cher's high-tech (for '95) wardrobe system that was ahead of its time — and honestly, still is.
